## ⚠️ Safety Guidelines

### General Safety
- Only trained individuals may operate this machine  
- **Ask a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> or <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span> for help if unsure**  
- Maintain a **clean, dry, well-lit workspace**  
- Do not operate in **wet or damp environments**  
- Keep **unauthorised persons** away  

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear **safety goggles**  
- Avoid **loose clothing or jewellery** near moving parts  
- Tie back long hair  
- Wear **non-slip footwear**  
- Additional PPE: dust mask if cutting plastics or generating fine dust  

### Electrical Safety
- Use only with 230 V AC power supply  
- **Check power cables for damage before use**  
- **Do not use damaged cables**  
- **Disconnect the machine from power before blade/tool changes or maintenance**  

### Tool-Specific Safety
- Keep fingers at least 50 mm clear of blade during operation  
- Clamp or firmly hold workpiece flat on the table — never cut unsupported material  
- Do not force abrupt curves or twists into the blade  
- Ensure blade teeth point downward and tension is set correctly  
- Only use blades suitable for the material thickness/type  
- Release blade tension after extended use to prolong blade life

## ▶️ Operation

### Starting the Machine
- Ensure the blade is correctly installed, teeth pointing down, and tensioned  
- Check the table is flat, tilt angle locked, and workpiece flush  
- Confirm blade guard is in place and lowered  

### Procedure
- Feed the workpiece steadily — do not force  
	- Blade cuts only when moving in downward stroke  
- For thick or hard material: reduce cutting speed using the dial  
- Follow material-specific guidance (e.g., cut along wood grain, lower speed for plastics/metals)  

### Internal Cuts / Special Operations (if applicable)
- Drill a pilot hole, thread the blade through the workpiece, and re-tension before cutting internal shapes  

### 🔴 Shutdown Procedure
1. Switch off the machine using the red OFF button  
2. Unplug from mains socket  
3. Remove the workpiece and release blade tension if required  
4. Wait until the blade stops fully  
5. Clean down the work area (see [[ScrollSaw_Splash|After Use checklist]])
