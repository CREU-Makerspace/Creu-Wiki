# Troubleshooting & Maintenance ‚Äì Rayjet R400 Laser Cutter

*This page provides guidance for <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pros</span> and <span class="red-apron">Supervisors</span>.  
Students should not attempt repairs beyond routine checks.* ---

## üîé Troubleshooting

**Laser is not cutting through the material** - Laser is out of focus. Re-run the autofocus procedure.
- Power setting is too low or speed is too high. Check the approved settings for your material.
- Lens or mirrors are dirty. Report to a supervisor for cleaning.

**Sustained flame or fire on the material** - **STOP THE JOB IMMEDIATELY.** Keep the lid closed. Notify a supervisor. The material may be unsuitable, or settings are incorrect (power too high, speed too slow).

**Engraving is faint or inconsistent** - The material surface is not flat. Use weights or tape to secure it.
- The source image is low resolution. Use a high-DPI raster image for engraving.
- Laser is out of focus. Re-focus on the material surface.

**JobControl software cannot connect to the laser** - Check the laser cutter is powered on at the wall and with the key switch.
- Check the USB cable is securely connected to both the laser and the computer.
- Restart the JobControl software.

**Excessive smoke is escaping the enclosure** - **STOP THE JOB IMMEDIATELY.** The fume extraction may be blocked, switched off, or failing. Report to a supervisor.

*(Add more cases based on manual/SOP; keep concise and practical.)*
