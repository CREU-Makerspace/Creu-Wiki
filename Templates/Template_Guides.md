<!--
Authoring helper:
1) Use only theme-approved emojis for section headers: 📋 ▶️ 🛡️ 🔎 📚
2) Keep Quick Steps scannable; put details below.
3) Use apron colour classes for roles when helpful:
   <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span>, <span class="black-apron">Staff</span>, <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span>.
4) You can use callouts for emphasis:
   > [!warning] Supervisor Approval  
   > Do not attempt repairs without a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span>.
5) Use a supportive tone. Example for non-fault issues:
   "⚠️ Please note: Not all issues are equipment faults. If something isn’t working as expected,
    it may be due to setup or technique. Check the Safety & Operation page and ask a Maker-Pro or Supervisor for guidance."
6) Add FAQs relevant to the system in use (e.g., MS Teams channels, booking portals, induction forms) so students know where to check updates or next steps.
