## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines

### General Safety
- Only trained individuals may operate this machine  
- **Ask a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> or <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span> for help if unsure** - Maintain a **clean, dry, well-lit workspace** - Do not operate in **wet or damp environments** - Keep **unauthorised persons** away  

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear **safety goggles** - Avoid **loose clothing or jewellery** near moving parts  
- Tie back long hair  
- Wear **non-slip footwear** - Additional PPE: **Heat-resistant gloves for print removal. Fume extraction is required when printing with high-VOC materials like ABS/ASA.**

### Electrical Safety
- Use only with a **standard 230 V / 50 Hz UK socket** 
- **Check power cables for damage before use** 
- **Do not use damaged cables** 
- **Disconnect the machine from power before maintenance** 

### 3D Printer Specific Safety
- **NEVER leave the printer running unattended**, especially during the first layer.
- Keep the enclosure door and top cover **closed at all times** during operation.
- The enclosure contains fumes, but the area must still be well-ventilated, especially when printing ABS/ASA.
- Do not defeat or bypass the door sensor or any other safety interlock.
- Allow the enclosure to vent for a minute before reaching inside to remove a print made from high-VOC materials.
- Beware of hot components (nozzle, bed, motors) inside the enclosure, which remains hot after printing.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Operation

### Starting the Machine
- Load **.3mf or G-code file** from Bambu Studio  
- Verify **print settings (layer height, infill, supports)** and material setup  
- Secure **the correct build plate (e.g., Textured PEI, Engineering Plate)** according to guidance  
- Confirm the enclosure door is closed to begin the print cycle.

### Procedure
- Start job and monitor progress for the first few layers to ensure good adhesion  
- Do not reach inside machine while in operation  
- Pause/abort if faults occur (e.g., print detaches, filament tangles, grinding noises)  

### üî¥ Shutdown Procedure
1. Allow the print job to complete and the toolhead to park.  
2. Let the build plate and enclosure cool before opening the door and removing the printed part.
3. Switch off the printer using the control panel, followed by the main power switch at the rear.  
4. Remove any purged filament or debris from the work area.
5. Clean down work area (see [[BambuP1S_Splash|After Use checklist]])
