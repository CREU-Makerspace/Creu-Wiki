## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Detailed Instructions

### 1. Stop using the equipment
- Power down following the specific tool‚Äôs Safety & Operation guide.  
- If urgent or dangerous, immediately notify a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span>.  

### 2. Notify a Supervisor
- Always inform a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> as soon as you stop using the equipment.  
- Supervisors are listed on the [[KeyPeople|Key People]] page or can be identified by red aprons in the Makerspace.  
- If the MS Form requires an *Attempted Fix* entry, the <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> must approve or observe before this is completed.  

### 3. Complete the Fault Report
- Use the online [Fault Report Form](https://forms.office.com/e/Avbq9JJgqw).  
- Provide as much detail as possible, including:  
  - Your name and student ID  
  - Equipment name (select from the list if available)  
  - Clear description of what happened (what you saw, heard, or felt)  
  - When the issue occurred (date and time)  
  - **Severity level** ‚Üí choose **Major** if the fault makes the equipment unsafe to use, otherwise **Minor**  

üìñ *Examples:*  
- Equipment: **Soldering Station**  
  - Fault Description: Tip not heating even when power light is on.  
  - Severity: **Major** ‚Äî cannot solder safely.  

- Equipment: **Scroll Saw**  
  - Fault Description: Blade keeps slipping off the guide roller during use.  
  - Severity: **Minor** ‚Äî still usable but unreliable.  

### 4. Mark the equipment (if still broken)
- Flip the information sheet over to the **FAULT** side.  
- Secure it in clear view on the equipment.  

### 5. Clear the workstation (if still broken)
- If safe, tidy tools and materials before leaving the area.

## üõ°Ô∏è Important Notes
- Do **not** attempt any repair without approval from a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span>.  
- A fault report **must** be logged if anything unexpected occurs.  
  - Examples include:  
    - Damaged cables or loose parts  
    - Excessive vibration or unusual noises  
    - Electrical faults  
    - Missing or broken guards  

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note: Not all issues are equipment faults.  
If something isn‚Äôt working as expected, it may be due to setup or technique. In these cases, check the Safety & Operation page for the tool, and ask a Maker-Pro or <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> for guidance.

## üîé Troubleshooting / FAQs
**Q:** What if I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a real fault?  
**A:** Log it anyway. It‚Äôs better to over-report than miss a safety issue. Supervisors will confirm.  

**Q:** What if the Fault Report Form link doesn‚Äôt work?  
**A:** Notify a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> immediately and give them details so they can log it on your behalf.  

**Q:** How will I know when the equipment is available again?  
**A:** Check the *Fault Log Status* app in **MS Teams ‚Äì CREU: The Digital Toolkit** for updates.
