## 📋 Quick Steps
1. Check the Fault Log spreadsheet **at the start of each shift** and whenever notified of a new fault.  
2. Review the fault and set an **Expected Online** date.  
3. Refer to the SOP or manual for troubleshooting.  
4. If authorised and safe, attempt the fix.  
5. When fixed, update **Status**, **Date Resolved**, and resolution details.  
6. If unsure, escalate to a <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> member before taking action.

## ▶️ Detailed Instructions

### 1. Checking the Fault Log
- Access the shared Excel fault log (linked via MS Teams).  
- New rows are created automatically whenever a Fault Report Form is submitted.  
- Columns **A:I** are auto-completed by Power Automate — **do not edit them**.  
- Supervisors must check the log **at the start of each shift** and after any student notification.  

### 2. Reviewing Faults
- Read the *Fault Description* and *Severity Level*.  
- Confirm whether a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> has already been notified.  
- If urgent or high severity, act immediately.  
- Enter a realistic **Expected Online** date (dd/MM/yyyy).  
  - This field is visible to students in MS Teams — please ensure it is filled in and updated if timelines change.  

### 3. Attempting a Fix
- First, check the **Safety & Operation (SOP) page** for the equipment.  
- If the SOP includes troubleshooting, follow those steps.  
- If not covered in the SOP/manual, **do not attempt a fix without <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> approval**.  

### 4. Updating the Log
When a fault is **open**:  
- **Status** → stays *Broken*.  
- **Expected Online** → provide your best estimate when equipment should be available.  
- **Resolution Summary** → add notes if any troubleshooting attempted.  

When a fault is **resolved**:  
- **Status** → change from *Broken* to *Fixed*.  
- **Resolved By** → enter your name/initials.  
- **Date Resolved** → enter the actual resolution date (dd/MM/yyyy).  
- **Resolution Summary** → record what was done.  
- **Additional Notes** → optional, for context or follow-up.  

🛠️ *Example resolution summaries:*  
- Pillar Drill — Adjusted drive belt tension, noise resolved. Status set to Fixed.  
- Soldering Station — Replaced tip, heating restored. Status set to Fixed.  

### 5. Leaving a Fault Open
- If the issue cannot yet be resolved, leave *Status* as *Broken*.  
- Ensure *Expected Online* reflects the most up-to-date estimate.  
- If the fault is outside Supervisor scope, escalate to <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> immediately and ensure the equipment remains marked with the **FAULT** sheet.

## 🛡️ Important Notes
- **Do not** edit *FormID* or Columns A:I — they are critical to automation.  
- Always use **Short Date format (dd/MM/yyyy)** for *Expected Online* and *Date Resolved*.  
- Never attempt a repair that is not explicitly covered in the SOP/manual without <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> approval.  
- Safety takes priority: if a machine is unsafe, ensure it is clearly marked with the **FAULT** sheet.

## 🔎 Troubleshooting / FAQs
**Q:** What if I’m not sure if I can fix the fault?  
**A:** Stop and ask a <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> member. Do not proceed unless authorised.  

**Q:** What if the spreadsheet seems broken or columns don’t update?  
**A:** Contact <span class="black-apron">Staff</span> immediately — do not attempt to alter automation fields.  

**Q:** What if the Expected Online date has passed but the machine is still broken?  
**A:** Update the date immediately and add a note in “Additional Notes” to explain the delay.
