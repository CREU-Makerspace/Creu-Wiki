## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Review safety** → follow Essentials above  
2. **Check blade** → correct type for material (pinned or pinless), properly tensioned, and teeth pointing downwards  
3. **Adjust settings** → set speed using dial (slower for harder/thicker materials), tilt table if angled cut required, lock table nut  
4. **Secure workpiece** → place flat on table, hold firmly with both hands, never within 50 mm of blade  
5. **Power on** → plug in, press green ON button, adjust speed as needed

## 🔄 Blade Changes
**Note for <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pros</span> and <span class="red-apron">Supervisors</span> only.**

- **Pinned blades** → Fit into upper and lower supports with pins seated; teeth pointing down  
- **Pinless blades** → Use adapters, secure blade ends with hex key, install bottom first, then compress arm to seat top  
- Always **disconnect power** before making changes
