## ⚠️ Key Hazards
- Hot surfaces (nozzle can reach 300°C, bed can reach 100°C)  
- High-speed moving parts (CoreXY gantry)
- Inhalation of fumes when enclosure is opened after printing ABS/ASA

**Emergency Information:** - First aid kit: **next to the rear entrance** of B005  
- First aiders: available **behind reception** - All students must have the **SafeZone app installed on their phone** for emergencies

*(Detailed hazard controls: see [[BambuP1S_Safety_Operation|Safety & Operation]].)*
