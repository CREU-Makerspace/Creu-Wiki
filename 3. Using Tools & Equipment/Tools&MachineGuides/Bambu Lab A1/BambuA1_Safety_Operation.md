## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines

### General Safety
- Only trained individuals may operate this machine  
- **Ask a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> or <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span> for help if unsure** - Maintain a **clean, dry, well-lit workspace** - Do not operate in **wet or damp environments** - Keep **unauthorised persons** away  

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear **safety goggles** 
- Avoid **loose clothing or jewellery** near moving parts  
- Tie back long hair  
- Wear **non-slip footwear** 
- Additional PPE: **Fume extraction is recommended for high-VOC materials (ABS, ASA)** 
### Electrical Safety
- Use only with a **standard 230 V / 50 Hz UK socket** 
- **Check power cables for damage before use** 
- **Do not use damaged cables** 
- **Disconnect the machine from power before maintenance** 
### 3D Printer Specific Safety
- **NEVER leave the printer running unattended**, especially during the first layer.
- Only use materials from the approved list. Unapproved filaments can damage the machine or release toxic fumes.
- Keep the area around the printer clear of any flammable materials (e.g., paper, aerosols, solvents).
- Allow the build plate and nozzle to cool down completely before removing prints or performing maintenance.
- Do not attempt to clear a nozzle jam while the machine is powered on and the hotend is heated.
- Ensure filament is stored in a dry environment to prevent moisture absorption, which can cause print failures.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Operation

### Starting the Machine
- Load **.3mf or G-code file** from Bambu Studio
- Verify **print settings (layer height, infill, supports)** and material setup
- Secure **the correct build plate (e.g., Textured PEI, Cool Plate)** according to guidance
- Confirm safety interlocks are engaged  

### Procedure
- Start job and monitor progress for the first few layers to ensure good adhesion
- Do not reach inside machine while in operation  
- Pause/abort if faults occur (e.g., print detaches, filament tangles, grinding noises)  

### üî¥ Shutdown Procedure
1. Allow the print job to complete and the toolhead to park.
2. Let the build plate cool before carefully removing the printed part.
3. Remove any purged filament or debris from the work area.
4. Clean down work area (see [[BambuA1_Splash|After Use checklist]])
