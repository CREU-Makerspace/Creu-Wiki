## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines

### General Safety
- Only trained individuals may operate this machine  
- **Ask a <span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span> or <span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span> for help if unsure** - Maintain a **clean, dry, well-lit workspace** - Do not operate in **wet or damp environments** - Keep **unauthorised persons** away  

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear **safety goggles** as a minimum requirement within the room.
- Avoid **loose clothing or jewellery**
- Tie back long hair  
- Wear **non-slip footwear** - Additional PPE: **None required for normal operation due to the interlocked enclosure.**

### Electrical Safety
- Use only with **the dedicated high-power socket**.
- **Check power cables for damage before use** - **Do not use damaged cables** - **Disconnect the machine from power before maintenance** ### Laser-Specific Safety
- **FIRE RISK IS INHERENT. Stay by the machine for the entire job.** Know where the nearest CO2 fire extinguisher is.
- **NEVER cut unapproved materials.** PVC, vinyl, and certain plastics release chlorine gas, which is toxic and will destroy the machine.
- **NEVER defeat the safety interlocks on the lid.** Opening the lid immediately stops the laser beam.
- If a fire occurs, stop the job. If the fire is small, keep the lid closed to starve it of oxygen and notify a supervisor.
- The fume extraction system MUST be running for all jobs, regardless of material.
- The invisible CO2 laser beam can cause instant and permanent eye damage. Do not operate with panels removed.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Operation

### Starting the Machine
- Load **vector files (AI, SVG, DXF, PDF)** into the Rayjet JobControl software.
- Verify **power, speed, and frequency settings** in the material database for your specific material and thickness.
- Secure **the material flat on the honeycomb bed**, using weights or masking tape on edges if it is warped.
- Confirm safety interlocks are engaged by closing the lid.

### Procedure
- Start job and monitor the cutting process **at all times**.
- Watch for any sustained flames (small flare-ups are normal) or excessive smoke.
- Pause/abort if faults occur (e.g., fire, material shifting, strange noises).

### üî¥ Shutdown Procedure
1. Allow the job to complete and the laser head to park.
2. Wait 30 seconds for fumes to clear before opening the lid.
3. Switch off the laser cutter via the key and control panel.
4. Remove your workpiece and all small offcuts from the bed.
5. Clean down work area (see [[RayjetR400_Splash|After Use checklist]])
