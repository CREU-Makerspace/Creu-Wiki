## ⚠️ Safety Guidelines

### General Safety

- Only trained individuals familiar with the machine and its risks may operate it.
- **Ask a trained Maker-Pro or Supervisors for help if you are unsure**.
- Maintain a **clean, dry, and well-lit workspace**.
- Do not operate the saw in **wet or damp environments**.
- Keep **unauthorised persons** away from the machine.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

- Wear **safety goggles** during cutting.
- Avoid **loose clothing, jewellery**, near moving parts.
- Tie back long hair
- Use **non-slip footwear** when working.

### Electrical Safety

- Use only with a **230 V / 50 Hz** power supply and a **16 A slow-blow fuse**.
- Inspect power cables regularly. **Do not use damaged cables**.
- Disconnect the saw from power before performing any maintenance or blade changes.

### Scroll Saw Specific Safety

- Use the **blade guard** at all times.
- Do not cut pieces **too small to hold securely**.
- Avoid awkward hand positions that could lead to contact with the blade.
- **Do not place your fingers under the blade guard whilst cutting**
- Never leave the saw running unattended.
- Do not perform layout or setup work on the table while the blade is moving.
- Ensure the **table is clear** of all objects except the workpiece before starting.

## 🧰 Operating Instructions

### Starting the Saw

- Ensure the **blade is properly installed and tensioned**.
- Check that the **table is aligned** and the **angle scale is set** if needed.
- Confirm the **blade guard is in place**.
### Cutting Procedure

- Feed the wood **slowly and steadily** against the blade.
- Cutting occurs only during the **downward stroke** of the blade.
- For wood thicker than **2.5 cm**, feed even more slowly and avoid sharp curves.
- The blade will naturally follow the **grain of the wood**.
- Harder materials, such as metals will require a slower cutting speed.
### Internal Cuts

- Drill a **6 mm hole** in the workpiece.
- Thread the blade through the hole and the table slot.
- Secure the blade and proceed with the cut.
- Remove the blade before removing the workpiece.
