### 🧰 Getting Started

1. **Review the safety section above**: Make sure you understand and follow all safety precautions before operating the FormBox.
2. **Connect the vacuum**: Plug the vacuum cleaner into the FormBox and attach the hose to the vacuum port
3. **Insert your sheet**: Clamp a Mayku sheet between the trays and lift it to the heater
4. **Set time and temperature**: Use the dial settings based on the sheet type
5. **Prepare your template**: Ensure no undercuts, add draft angles, and position centrally
6. **Start the timer**: Press the start button and wait for the sheet to soften
7. **Form your shape**: Pull the trays down over the template—vacuum activates automatically
8. **Cool and release**: Let the form cool, unclamp, and remove your mold
