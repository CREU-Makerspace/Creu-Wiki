## üîé Troubleshooting

**Print not sticking to bed / poor first layer** 
- Build plate is dirty or has fingerprints. Clean with warm soapy water, then Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA).
- Build plate type is incorrect for the material. Ensure you are using the correct plate and settings in Bambu Studio.

**Filament grinding or not extruding (clog)** 
- Nozzle is clogged. Heat the nozzle and use the provided pin to clear it. For severe clogs, report to a Supervisor for a "cold pull" or hotend replacement.
- Filament is tangled on the spool in the AMS Lite. Check the spool and ensure it can rotate freely.

**Layer shifting (misaligned layers)** 
- Print speed is too high or acceleration is too aggressive for the model's geometry. Reduce speeds in the slicer.
- Debris on the carbon rods or guide rails. Report to a Supervisor for cleaning and inspection.

**"Spaghetti" or completely failed print** 
- The model has detached from the build plate. Re-clean the plate and consider adding a brim or raft in the slicer settings.
- The model requires supports that were not generated. Re-slice the model with appropriate supports for overhangs.

**AMS Lite fails to load or unload filament** 
- The filament tip is not clean-cut. Trim the filament to a point before loading.
- The PTFE tube path is too constrained or bent. Ensure the tubes have a smooth path from the AMS to the toolhead.

*(Add more cases based on manual/SOP; keep concise and practical.)*

## üß∞ Routine Maintenance

**<span class="blue-apron">Maker-Pro</span> checks** - Clean the build plate with IPA before each print.
- Regularly empty the purge/poop chute at the rear of the printer.
- Keep the carbon fibre rods clean by wiping with a dry microfibre cloth.

**<span class="red-apron">Supervisor</span>-only** - Lubricate Z-axis lead screws according to the manufacturer's schedule.
- Replace worn quick-swap hotends or extruder gears.
- Check and tension X and Y-axis belts if layer shifting becomes a common issue.
